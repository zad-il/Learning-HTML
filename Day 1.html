<p>I've been learning HTML for a few days now.</p>
<p>Even though life feels overwhelming, I'm still trying to keep going.</p>
<p>HTML is pretty cool — it's a structural framework, and learning it has been quite interesting.</p>
<p>Tonight, I'm looking for a poem I love, and if I find it, I’ll write it here.</p>

A Dream Within a Dream
By Edgar Allan Poe

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow —
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone? 
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand —
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep — while I weep!
O God! Can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?
</pre>
