<h1>A Dream</h1>
<hr>
<div>
Well, after about a month and a half of being stuck in what felt like a prison called life.
today I finally went into the city and walked around a lot.
I didn’t have any money to buy anything or do anything, just walked.
Honestly, I kept thinking about why I don’t live there, and I felt pretty jealous of people’s lifestyles and how they live.
I’m stuck in a worthless and trashy place.
When I came back to this place, I had a weird feeling, like this is my reality or maybe today was just a dream.
